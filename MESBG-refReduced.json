Non-Spirit models targeted by Galadriel's Banishment gain a single 'free'’' point of Will to immediately Resist this Magical Power. Additionally, friendly models within 3\" of Galadriel gain Resistant to Magic. \n\"The Grey Wanderer\" - Gandalf gains the Fearless special rule. Furthermore, friendly models within 3\" of Gandalf cannot have their Courage value reduced by enemy Magical Powers or special rules.\n\"Lord of Imladris\" - Elrond may declare a Heroic Strike every Fight phase without expending Might. Additionally, other friendly models within 3\" of Elrond count as being in range of a banner.\n\"Wisest of the Istari\" - Saruman can attempt to cast two Magical Powers each turn rather than one, but may not attempt to cast the same Magical Power twice or target the same model twice.

On a 4 or 5, the chosen model regains a Wound lost earlier in the battle; on a 6, the model regains all of its lost Wounds. Additionally, friendly models within 3\" of Radagast may move through difficult terrain without penalty.\n“Go Back to the Void, from Whence You Came!” - Once per game, if Galadriel has at least 1 Will point remaining, Galadriel may choose to exert her full power instead of casting a Magical Power. If she does so, then she immediately casts the channelled version of the Banishment Magical Power, which cannot be resisted. Models may use Fate to prevent these Wounds individually as normal. However, immediately after casting the Banishment Magical Power in this way, place Galadriel prone and reduce her Will to 0. Additionally, for the rest of the battle she does not benefit from her The Lady of Lothlórien and War Aspect special rules.\nThe Vanquishers of the Necromancer must always include Galadriel, Lady of Light, Gandalf the Grey, and Saruman the White. Saruman the White is always the army's leader."
